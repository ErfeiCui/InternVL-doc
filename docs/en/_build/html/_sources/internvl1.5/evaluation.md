# Evaluation of InternVL 1.5 Series

To evaluate the performance of the InternVL 1.5 series across various tasks, follow the instructions for each specific dataset. Ensure that the appropriate number of GPUs is allocated as specified.
The following tests will primarily use `InternVL-Chat-V1-5` as an example.

> 1‚É£Ô∏è We simultaneously use InternVL and VLMEvalKit repositories for model evaluation. Specifically, the results reported for DocVQA, ChartQA, InfoVQA, TextVQA, MME, AI2D, MMBench, CCBench, MMVet, and SEED-Image were tested using the InternVL repository. OCRBench, RealWorldQA, HallBench, and MathVista were evaluated using the VLMEvalKit.

> 2‚É£Ô∏è Please note that evaluating the same model using different testing toolkits like InternVL and VLMEvalKit can result in slight differences, which is normal. Updates to code versions and variations in environment and hardware can also cause minor discrepancies in results.

> 3‚É£Ô∏èÔ∏è Note, the dataset description is generated by GPT-4 and may contain errors.

MVBench is a comprehensive multimodal video understanding benchmark developed to evaluate the temporal comprehension capabilities of MLLMs. It includes 20 challenging video tasks that require temporal understanding and cannot be effectively solved using a single frame. The benchmark uses a novel static-to-dynamic method, transforming static tasks into dynamic ones to systematically generate video tasks that demand a wide range of temporal skills, from perception to cognition.

We evaluate our models on MVBench by extracting 16 frames from each video, and each frame was resized to a 448x448 image.

```bash
GPUS=8 sh evaluate.sh pretrained/InternVL-Chat-V1-5 mvbench --dynamic --max-num 1
