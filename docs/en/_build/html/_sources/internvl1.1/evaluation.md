# Evaluation of InternVL-Chat-V1-1

To evaluate the performance of the InternVL-Chat-V1-1 model across various tasks, follow the instructions for each specific dataset. Ensure that the appropriate number of GPUs is allocated as specified.

> 1‚É£Ô∏è We simultaneously use InternVL and VLMEvalKit repositories for model evaluation. For certain datasets like MMVet and LLaVA-Bench, different GPT-4 versions used as judges cause significant result discrepancies between two codebases.

> 2‚É£Ô∏è Please note that evaluating the same model using different testing toolkits like InternVL and VLMEvalKit can result in slight differences, which is normal. Updates to code versions and variations in environment and hardware can also cause minor discrepancies in results.

> 3‚É£Ô∏èÔ∏è Note, the dataset description is generated by GPT-4 and may contain errors.
