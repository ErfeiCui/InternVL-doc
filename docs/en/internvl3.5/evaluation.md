# Evaluation of InternVL3.5 Series

To evaluate the performance of the InternVL3.5 series across various tasks, follow the instructions for each specific dataset. Ensure that the appropriate number of GPUs is allocated as specified.

> 1⃣️ We mainly use VLMEvalKit repositories for model evaluation.

> 2⃣️ Please note that evaluating the same model using different testing toolkits like InternVL and VLMEvalKit can result in slight differences, which is normal. Updates to code versions and variations in environment and hardware can also cause minor discrepancies in results.

Please refer to their [document](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit/blob/main/docs/en/Quickstart.md) for more details.
