# InternVL-Chat-V1-2

## Introduction

We are excited to introduce [ü§ó InternVL-Chat-V1-2](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVL-Chat-V1-2). Inspired by [LLaVA-NeXT-34B](https://llava-vl.github.io/blog/2024-01-30-llava-next/), we have also adopted [Nous-Hermes-2-Yi-34B](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Yi-34B) as the language model. Below is the pipeline.

</p>

From the experimental results, we've observed that **a stronger language model (34B) can better leverage the powerful capabilities of our vision foundation model.**

For better training reproducibility, we follow the minimalist design and data efficiency similar to LLaVA-NeXT. To reduce training costs, we provide a [pre-trained MLP projector](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternViT-6B-448px-V1-2/blob/main/mlp_projector/hermes_2_yi_34b.pth) and only employ around 1.2 million visual instruction tuning samples for SFT. Our model has a total of 40 billion parameters and can be trained within 1.5 days using 32 A100 GPUs. The code, data, and model have been made publicly available.

Additionally, [ü§ó InternVL-Chat-V1-2-Plus](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVL-Chat-V1-2-Plus) uses the same model architecture as InternVL-Chat-V1-2, but the difference lies in the SFT dataset. InternVL-Chat-V1-2 only utilizes an SFT dataset with 1.2M samples, while our plus version employs an SFT dataset with 12M samples.

- Note that we use the [official evaluation server](https://huggingface.co/spaces/whyu/MM-Vet_Evaluator) to test the MMVet scores, with `GPT-4-0613` serving as the judge model. Using different versions of GPT-4 as the judge can result in significant score variations.

Here, we have conducted only a simple performance comparison. For more detailed performance information and additional evaluation metrics, please refer to our performance summary table.

## Quick Start

We provide an example code to run InternVL-Chat-V1-2-Plus using `transformers`.

We also welcome you to experience the InternVL2 series models in our [online demo](https://internvl.opengvlab.com/).

> Please use transformers==4.37.2 to ensure the model works normally.

### Model Loading

#### 16-bit (bf16 / fp16)

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
path = "OpenGVLab/InternVL-Chat-V1-2-Plus"
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    path,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    low_cpu_mem_usage=True,
    trust_remote_code=True).eval().cuda()
```

#### BNB 8-bit Quantization

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
path = "OpenGVLab/InternVL-Chat-V1-2-Plus"
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    path,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    load_in_8bit=True,
    low_cpu_mem_usage=True,
    trust_remote_code=True).eval()
```

#### BNB 4-bit Quantization

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Due to significant quantization errors with BNB 4-bit quantization on InternViT-6B, the model may produce nonsensical outputs and fail to understand images. Therefore, please avoid using BNB 4-bit quantization.

#### Multiple GPUs

The reason for writing the code this way is to avoid errors that occur during multi-GPU inference due to tensors not being on the same device. By ensuring that the first and last layers of the large language model (LLM) are on the same device, we prevent such errors.

```python
import math
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

def split_model(model_name):
    device_map = {}
    world_size = torch.cuda.device_count()
    num_layers = {'InternVL-Chat-V1-2': 60, 'InternVL-Chat-V1-2-Plus': 60}[model_name]
    # Since the first GPU will be used for ViT, treat it as half a GPU.
    num_layers_per_gpu = math.ceil(num_layers / (world_size - 0.5))
    num_layers_per_gpu = [num_layers_per_gpu] * world_size
    num_layers_per_gpu[0] = math.ceil(num_layers_per_gpu[0] * 0.5)
    layer_cnt = 0
    for i, num_layer in enumerate(num_layers_per_gpu):
        for j in range(num_layer):
            device_map[f'language_model.model.layers.{layer_cnt}'] = i
            layer_cnt += 1
    device_map['vision_model'] = 0
    device_map['mlp1'] = 0
    device_map['language_model.model.tok_embeddings'] = 0
    device_map['language_model.model.embed_tokens'] = 0
    device_map['language_model.output'] = 0
    device_map['language_model.model.norm'] = 0
    device_map['language_model.lm_head'] = 0
    device_map[f'language_model.model.layers.{num_layers - 1}'] = 0

    return device_map

path = "OpenGVLab/InternVL-Chat-V1-2-Plus"
device_map = split_model('InternVL-Chat-V1-2-Plus')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    path,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    low_cpu_mem_usage=True,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    device_map=device_map).eval()
```

#### Multi-image multi-round conversation, combined images

> **‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Warning:** Please note that for this model, we support multi-image chat in the interface, but the results are not very good due to the lack of training with multi-image data.

#### Streaming output

Besides this method, you can also use the following code to get streamed output.

```python
from transformers import TextIteratorStreamer
from threading import Thread

# Initialize the streamer
streamer = TextIteratorStreamer(tokenizer, skip_prompt=True, skip_special_tokens=True, timeout=10)
# Define the generation configuration

### 2. Training Datasets Preparation

Inspired by LLaVA-NeXT, we adopted a data-efficient SFT strategy to train InternVL-Chat-V1-2, utilizing approximately 1.2M of visual instruction tuning samples in total, all of which are fully open-source. In a macro sense, we build upon [ShareGPT-4V](https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-XComposer/blob/main/projects/ShareGPT4V/docs/Data.md#prepare-images) and additionally integrate [LLaVA-ZH](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openbmb/llava_zh), [DVQA](https://github.com/kushalkafle/DVQA_dataset), [ChartQA](https://github.com/vis-nlp/ChartQA), [AI2D](https://allenai.org/data/diagrams), [DocVQA](https://www.docvqa.org/datasets), [GeoQA+](https://github.com/SCNU203/GeoQA-Plus), and [SynthDoG-EN](https://huggingface.co/datasets/naver-clova-ix/synthdog-en). Most of the data remains consistent with LLaVA-NeXT.

First, download the [annotation files](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVL/resolve/main/playground.zip) and place them in the `playground/opensource/` folder.

Second, download all the images we used.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Note that in the `sharegpt4v_mix665k_cap23k_coco-ap9k_lcs3k_sam9k_div2k.jsonl` file, the format of the RefCOCO data is consistent with LLaVA 1.5, which is `[x1, y1, x2, y2]` with coordinates ranging from `0-1`. During the training of InternVL-Chat-V1-2, we did not apply any special processing to this format. However, for the training of InternVL-Chat-V1-2-Plus, we converted the coordinate format to `<box>[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]</box>` and adjusted the coordinate range to `0-1000`.

Then, organize the data as follows in `playground/data`:

### 3. Start Training

We provide slurm scripts for multi-node multi-GPU training. You can use either 32 or 64 GPUs to train this model. If you use 64 GPUs, training will take approximately 18 hours.

- If you encounter an OOM error, you can decrease the `PER_DEVICE_BATCH_SIZE`, for example, set `PER_DEVICE_BATCH_SIZE=4`.

```sh
# using 32 GPUs
PARTITION='your partition' GPUS=32 PER_DEVICE_BATCH_SIZE=8 sh shell/internvl1.2/hermes2_yi34b/internvl_chat_v1_2_hermes2_yi34b_448_res_finetune.sh
# using 64 GPUs
PARTITION='your partition' GPUS=64 PER_DEVICE_BATCH_SIZE=8 sh shell/internvl1.2/hermes2_yi34b/internvl_chat_v1_2_hermes2_yi34b_448_res_finetune.sh
```

The hyperparameters used for fine-tuning are listed in the following table. And, you can view the training logs in tensorboard at [here](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVL-Chat-V1-2/tensorboard).

| Hyperparameter         | Trainable Param | Global Batch Size | Learning rate | Epoch | Max length | Weight decay |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ----- | ---------- | ------------ |
| InternVL-Chat-<br>V1-2 | 40B             | 512               | 1e-5          | 1     | 2048       | 0.05         |

## Fine-tune on a Custom Dataset

### 1. Model Preparation

| model name              | type | download                                                               |  size   |
| ----------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-----: |
| InternVL-Chat-V1-2      | MLLM | ü§ó [HF link](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVL-Chat-V1-2)      | 75.0 GB |
| InternVL-Chat-V1-2-Plus | MLLM | ü§ó [HF link](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVL-Chat-V1-2-Plus) | 75.0 GB |

Before starting the second fine-tuning, download the pre-trained model we provide. Two versions are available: [InternVL-Chat-V1-2](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVL-Chat-V1-2) and [InternVL-Chat-V1-2-Plus](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVL-Chat-V1-2-Plus). We recommend downloading the Plus version.

Use the following commands to download the desired model:

```shell
cd pretrained/
# pip install -U huggingface_hub
# Download OpenGVLab/InternVL-Chat-V1-2
huggingface-cli download --resume-download --local-dir-use-symlinks False OpenGVLab/InternVL-Chat-V1-2 --local-dir InternVL-Chat-V1-2
# Download OpenGVLab/InternVL-Chat-V1-2-Plus
huggingface-cli download --resume-download --local-dir-use-symlinks False OpenGVLab/InternVL-Chat-V1-2-Plus --local-dir InternVL-Chat-V1-2-Plus
```

The directory structure is:

```sh
pretrained
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ InternVL-Chat-V1-2
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ InternVL-Chat-V1-2-Plus
```

### 2. Prepare Your Customized Training Data

After downloading the pre-trained model, prepare your customized SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) data. Create a JSON file in `internvl_chat/shell/data/` similar to [this example](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVL/blob/main/internvl_chat/shell/data/internvl_1_2_finetune.json).

The format for the JSON file should be:

```json
{
  "your-custom-dataset-1": {
    "root": "path/to/the/image/",
    "annotation": "path/to/the/jsonl/annotation",
    "data_augment": false,
    "repeat_time": 1,
    "length": "number of your data"
  },
  ...
}
```

Example:

```json
{
  "sharegpt4v_instruct_gpt4-vision_cap100k": {
    "root": "playground/data/",
    "annotation": "playground/opensource/sharegpt4v_instruct_gpt4-vision_cap100k.jsonl",
    "data_augment": false,
    "repeat_time": 1,
    "length": 102025
  }
}
```

My suggestion is to add new domain-specific data on top of the [general data from our open-sourced InternVL 1.2](../internvl1.2/internvl_chat.md#training-datasets-preparation). This will enhance downstream capabilities while retaining the foundational skills. Of course, you can also choose to fine-tune solely on the new data based on your requirements.

### 3. Start 2nd Fine-tuning

Fine-tune the pre-trained models using either the [script for training the full LLM](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVL/blob/main/internvl_chat/shell/internvl1.2/2nd_finetune/internvl_chat_v1_2_hermes2_yi34b_448_res_2nd_finetune_full.sh)
or the [script for training the LoRA adapter](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVL/blob/main/internvl_chat/shell/internvl1.2/2nd_finetune/internvl_chat_v1_2_hermes2_yi34b_448_res_2nd_finetune_lora.sh), depending on your available GPU resources.

Before fine-tuning, set the `--meta_path` to the path of the JSON file you created in the previous step. The default pre-trained model path in these shell scripts is `./pretrained/InternVL-Chat-V1-2-Plus`.

> üí° Fine-tuning the full LLM requires at least 16 A100 80G GPUs, whereas fine-tuning the LoRA requires 2 A100 80G GPUs.

> üí° The number of GPUs and hyperparameters used here are just an example. To achieve optimal results, you may need to adjust these settings based on your available hardware and dataset size.

Commands for fine-tuning:

```sh
# Using 16 GPUs with SLURM system, fine-tune the full LLM, cost about 80G per GPU
PARTITION='your partition' GPUS=16 sh shell/internvl1.2/2nd_finetune/internvl_chat_v1_2_hermes2_yi34b_448_res_2nd_finetune_full.sh
# Using 2 GPUs, fine-tune the LoRA, without SLURM system, cost about 63G per GPU
GPUS=2 sh shell/internvl1.2/2nd_finetune/internvl_chat_v1_2_hermes2_yi34b_448_res_2nd_finetune_lora.sh
```

If you encounter any issues, please let me know, and I will update the training guide to enhance its usability.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the InternVL-Chat-V1-2-Plus model across various tasks, follow the instructions for each specific dataset. Ensure that the appropriate number of GPUs is allocated as specified.

> 1‚É£Ô∏è We simultaneously use InternVL and VLMEvalKit repositories for model evaluation. For certain datasets like MMVet and LLaVA-Bench, different GPT-4 versions used as judges cause significant result discrepancies between two codebases.

> 2‚É£Ô∏è Please note that evaluating the same model using different testing toolkits like InternVL and VLMEvalKit can result in slight differences, which is normal. Updates to code versions and variations in environment and hardware can also cause minor discrepancies in results.

> 3‚É£Ô∏èÔ∏è Note, the dataset description is generated by GPT-4 and may contain errors.
