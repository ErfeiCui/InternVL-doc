# Evaluation of InternVL2 Series

To evaluate the performance of the InternVL2 series across various tasks, follow the instructions for each specific dataset. Ensure that the appropriate number of GPUs is allocated as specified.

> 1‚É£Ô∏è We simultaneously use InternVL and VLMEvalKit repositories for model evaluation. Specifically, the results reported for DocVQA, ChartQA, InfoVQA, TextVQA, MME, AI2D, MMBench, CCBench, MMVet, and SEED-Image were tested using the InternVL repository. OCRBench, RealWorldQA, HallBench, and MathVista were evaluated using the VLMEvalKit.

> 2‚É£Ô∏è Please note that evaluating the same model using different testing toolkits like InternVL and VLMEvalKit can result in slight differences, which is normal. Updates to code versions and variations in environment and hardware can also cause minor discrepancies in results.

> 3‚É£Ô∏èÔ∏è Note, the dataset description is generated by GPT-4 and may contain errors.

The LLaVA-Bench-in-the-Wild dataset is designed to evaluate the capabilities of MLLMs in handling more complex and diverse visual tasks. It includes a set of 24 images with 60 associated questions, covering a range of indoor and outdoor scenes, memes, paintings, and sketches. Each image is paired with detailed, manually curated descriptions and questions that test the model's generalizability to novel domains.

### MVBench

MVBench is a comprehensive multimodal video understanding benchmark developed to evaluate the temporal comprehension capabilities of MLLMs. It includes 20 challenging video tasks that require temporal understanding and cannot be effectively solved using a single frame. The benchmark uses a novel static-to-dynamic method, transforming static tasks into dynamic ones to systematically generate video tasks that demand a wide range of temporal skills, from perception to cognition.

We evaluate our models on MVBench by extracting 16 frames from each video, and each frame was resized to a 448x448 image.

```bash
GPUS=8 sh evaluate.sh pretrained/InternVL2-1B mvbench --dynamic --max-num 1
```
