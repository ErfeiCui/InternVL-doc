# Introduction of InternVL-Chat-V1-1

We released [ðŸ¤— InternVL-Chat-V1-1](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVL-Chat-V1-1), featuring a structure similar to LLaVA, including a ViT, an MLP projector, and an LLM.
As shown in the figure below, we connected our InternViT-6B to LLaMA2-13B through a simple MLP projector. Note that the LLaMA2-13B used here is not the original model but an internal chat version obtained by incrementally pre-training and fine-tuning the LLaMA2-13B base model for Chinese language tasks. Overall, our model has a total of 19 billion parameters.

In this version, we explored increasing the resolution to 448 Ã— 448, enhancing OCR capabilities, and improving support for Chinese conversations. Since the 448 Ã— 448 input image generates 1024 visual tokens after passing through the ViT, leading to a significant computational burden, we use a pixel shuffle (unshuffle) operation to reduce the 1024 tokens to 256 tokens.

- Note that we use the [official evaluation server](https://huggingface.co/spaces/whyu/MM-Vet_Evaluator) to test the MMVet scores, with `GPT-4-0613` serving as the judge model. Using different versions of GPT-4 as the judge can result in significant score variations.

Here, we have conducted only a simple performance comparison. For more detailed performance information and additional evaluation metrics, please refer to our [performance summary table](<>).
